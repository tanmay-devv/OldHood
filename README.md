# Intro
OldHood is an application built for elderly people as a one stop to all their needs.

# Motivation Behind the Project
The motivation for creating this project stemmed from a desire to address a real-world problem and provide a practical solution. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, it's essential to develop innovative tools that can enhance efficiency, provide new insights, or improve user experiences. Participating in this hackathon provided an excellent opportunity to apply creative thinking, technical skills, and collaboration to build a project that not only showcases our abilities but also has the potential to make a meaningful impact. The aim was to challenge myself, learn new technologies, and contribute to a solution that could benefit others.
